\textbf{\large Problem Description}

Toby loves prime numbers and today he has the next challenge for you.
You have an integer $N$ ($N$ has between 1 and 4 digits), is possible to reorder the
digits of the number in such a way that one of the resulting numbers is a prime number?
Note: The resulting number can't have leading zeros.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases, in each of
the next $T$ lines there is an integer $N$.

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each test case you have to print ``YES'' if is possible to reorder the digits and make
a prime number or print ``NO'' otherwise.

\textbf{\large Sample Input}

\begin{verbatim}
6
1
7
712
209
24
1798
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Sample Output}

\begin{verbatim}
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Explanation:}

For the fourth case 209 can be reorder like this (029, 092, 209, 290, 902, 920), 029 is prime,
but is not a valid number because has leading zeros, in the valid numbers (209, 290, 902, 920).
there are no primes, so the answer is ``NO''

For the fith case 24 only has two possible numbers (24, 42) and there are no primes, so the
answer is ``NO''.
