\textbf{\large Problem Description}

Toby has $N$ flowers in a row; As you know he is a big fan of queries and got two types of them.

1 - of the form $1 X W $ water the flower on the position $X$, after watering the $X-th$ flower add $W$ to its size.\\
2 - of the form $2 L R $ retrieve the tallest flower in the range $[l, r]$.\\

May you help our little pet answering all queries?.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The input contains two numbers $N$, $Q$ denoting number of flowers and queries
respectively. In the next line $N$ numbers separated by spaces are given as the initial size of each flower.
The next $Q$ lines have 3 integers each one $T$, $A$, $B$; if $T == 1$ then $A$, $B$
are the position of the flower to be watered and the quantity that must be added to the current size respectively, and if
$T == 2$ then $A$, $B$ are the begin and the end of the interval where you need to find the tallest flower.

$1 \le N, Q \le 100000$ \\
$1 \le T \le 2 $\\
if $ T == 1 $:\\
$  1 \le A \le N $\\
$  -10^6 \le B \le 10^6$\\
if $ T == 2 $:\\
$  1 \le A \le B \le N $\\

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each query of type 2 print the tallest flower in the range $[L, R]$.
