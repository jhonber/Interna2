\textbf{\large Problem Description}

Toby has $N$ flowers in a row; As you know he is a big fan of queries and now
he has two queries for his flowers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $1$ $X$ $W$ water the flower at the position $X$, after watering the $Xth$ flower add $W$ to its size.
    \item $2$ $L$ $R$ retrieve the tallest flower in the range $[L, R]$.
\end{itemize}

Can you help our little pet answering all queries?

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The input contains two numbers $N$, $Q$ denoting number of flowers and queries
respectively. In the next line $N$ numbers separated by spaces are given as the initial size of each flower.
The next $Q$ lines start with an integer $T$, if $T$ is equal to 1 the line continues with
two numbers $X$ and $W$ indicating that the flower $X$ grows $W$ units. If $T$ equals 2, then
the line contains two numbers $L$ and $R$.

$1 \le N, Q \le 100000$ \\
$1 \le T \le 2 $\\
$1 \le X \le N$ \\
$-10^6 \le W \le 10^6$\\
$1 \le L \le R \le N $\\

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each query of type 2 print the tallest flower in the range $[L, R]$.

\textbf{\large Sample Input}

\begin{verbatim}
10 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4
2 1 10
1 6 -5

2 7 8
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Sample Output}

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Note}

When $W$ is negative, the size of the flower decreases.
