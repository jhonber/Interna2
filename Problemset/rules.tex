{	\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item CE: The program cannot be properly compiled or executed.
    \item TLE: The program uses too much time.
    \item RE: Run-time error. The program cannot terminate normally.
    \item MLE: The program uses too much memory.
    \item WA: The output is incorrect.
    \item AC: The program is accepted by the judge system, and the problem is solved.
    \end{itemize}
}
\item Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. Teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.

\item Breaking ties in ranking, if necessary, is according to the following order:
{	\setlength{\parskip}{1pt}
    \begin{enumerate}
  	\item the less total number of submissions of the solved problems;
  	\item the shorter elapsed time of the first solved problem;
  	\item the shorter elapsed time of the second solved problem, and so on.
  	\end{enumerate}
}
\end{enumerate}
