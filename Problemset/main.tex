the following $N$ lines, contains a pair of integers denoting the position of
one star.

$2 \le N \le 500$

Toby loves prime numbers and today he has the next challenge for you.
You have an integer $N$ ($N$ has between 1 and 4 digits), is possible to reorder the
digits of the number in such a way that one of the resulting numbers is a prime number?
Note: The resulting number can't have leading zeros.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases, in each of
the next $T$ lines there is an integer $N$.

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each test case you have to print ``YES'' if is possible to reorder the digits and make
a prime number or print ``NO'' otherwise.

\textbf{\large Sample Input}

\begin{verbatim}
6
1
7
712
209
24
1798
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Sample Output}

\begin{verbatim}
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Explanation:}

For the fourth case 209 can be reorder like this (029, 092, 209, 290, 902, 920), 029 is prime,
but is not a valid number because has leading zeros, in the valid numbers (209, 290, 902, 920).
there are no primes, so the answer is ``NO''

For the fith case 24 only has two possible numbers (24, 42) and there are no primes, so the
answer is ``NO''.

Toby just invented a game with numbers, initially you have a list of numbers
and at any moment you can do the following operation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Take two different numbers and replace the greater one with the absolute
    difference of those numbers.
    \item The game ends when all the numbers are equal.
\end{itemize}

It can be shown that the game always ends and no matter how you play, the result
will be always the same.

Help toby to determine what is the result for several instances of the game.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The input begins with an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. For each
test case, there is a number $N$ indicating how many numbers are in the current case,
followed by $N$ positive integers.

$1 \le N \le 100$

Each one of the $N$ numbers is between 1 and 10000

\textbf{\large Output Format}

Print one integer for each test case. Note that at end of each game all the
numbers are equal, for this reason you only need to print it once, no matter what
is the size of the input list.

Toby is now a shepherd and has a flock of sheeps all of them in a row, but alas there are wolves too, luckly our pet is pretty relaxed and will enter on panic only if when he sight a subsegment of his flock the number of wolves is greater than the number of sheeps.

Toby has few questions for you, as he is too lazy, he wants to ask you if for an given interval  (defined by $[L, R]$) there are more wolves than sheeps, you have to answer Yes or No.

Note: A sheep is represented by a '1' and a wolf is represented by a '0'.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

There are several test cases.
Each test case starts by a number $N$ denoting the number animals in the flock (sheeps and wolves), next you have to read $N$ numbers (0 or 1); followed by a number $Q$, the number of queries that Toby got for you, then $Q$ lines are given and you will have to read $L$ and $R$ denoting the begin and the end of the subsegment that Toby wants to check.

$1 \le N, Q \le 100000$ \\
$1 \le L \le R \le N$

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each query you have to output ``Yes'' if the numbers of wolves is greater than the numbers of sheeps, and ``No'' otherwise. Without quotes.

\end{itemize}

Help Toby to determine who will win for a several number of stones. Take into account that both players will play optimally.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The input begins with a number $T$ denoting the number of test cases. For each
test case a positive number $N$ is given and indicates the number of stones.

Toby lives in Bitland where things are a little weird,
by example 4 + 5 = 3 woow!. Definitely the addition is not like we know.
Toby like a regular citizen knows very well the process for addition in Bitland.
He say, ``Is easy, just count the total amount of bits turn on between numbers''

\textbf{\large Example}

$4 + 5 = 3$ \\
$4 -> 100$: there is 1 bit turn on \\
$5 -> 101$: there are 2 bits turn on \\

So the answer is 1 + 2 = 3

For this challenge you need to learn how Bitland's citizens add two number.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The first line contains an integer $T$, $(T \le 1000)$, the number of test cases,
each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ $(0 \le a,b \le 10^{18})$.

\textbf{\large Note:}

to store a and b you need more than 32 bits, so watch out! :P

Toby is analysing the railway system of his city, and he has noticed that it can
be modeled like a directed graph where the stations are the vertices and the edges
are the rails that connect them.

Toby got a lot queries for you and for each query he wants to know how many
stations are reachable if he is actually at the station $S$, by reachable he
means that can go from $S$ to an station $T$ using one or more rails.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The input contains two numbers $N$, $M$ denoting number of stations and rails
respectively. Each one of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $(X, Y)$
denoting that there is a connection from $X$ to $Y$, then one integer $Q$
denoting the number of queries that Toby is going to give to you, in the next $Q$
lines an integer $S$ is given, that is the city which toby wants to know how
many stations are reachable from it.

\textbf{\large Note:}

You can assume that $X$ and $Y$ are different.

$1 \le N, Q \le 1000$ \\
$0 \le M \le (N * (N - 1)) / 2$ % TODO: change value of M to 1000
