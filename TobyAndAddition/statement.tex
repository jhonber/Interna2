\textbf{\large Problem Description}

Toby lives in Bitland where things are a little weird,
by example 4 + 5 = 3 woow!. Definitely the addition is not like we know.
Toby like a regular citizen knows very well the process for addition in Bitland.
He say, ``Is easy, just count the total amount of bits turn on between numbers''

\textbf{\large Example}

$4 + 5 = 3$ \\
$4 -> 100$: there is 1 bit turn on \\
$5 -> 101$: there are 2 bits turn on \\

So the answer is 1 + 2 = 3

For this challenge you need to learn how Bitland's citizens add two number.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The first line contains an integer $T$, $(T \le 1000)$, the number of test cases,
each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ $(0 \le a,b \le 10^{18})$.

\textbf{\large Note:}

to store a and b you need more than 32 bits, so watch out! :P

\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each test case print a single integer with the answer.

\textbf{\large Sample Input}

\begin{verbatim}
5
1 1
8 64
4 5
66666666 33333333
576460752303423487 576460752303423487
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\large Sample Output}

\begin{verbatim}
2
2
3
26
118
\end{verbatim}
