# Toby and Addition

Toby lives in Bitland where things are a little weird,
by example 4 + 5 = 3 woow!. Definitely the addition is not like we know.
Toby like a regular citizen knows very well the process for addition in Bitland.
He say, "Is easy, just count the total amount of bits turn on between numbers"

### Example: 4 + 5 = 3
4 -> 100: there is 1 bit turn on
5 -> 101: there are 2 bits turn on

So the answer is 1 + 2 = 3

For this challenge you need to learn how Bitland's citizens add two number.

## Input

The first line contains an integer T, (T = 1000), the number of test cases,
each test case contains two integers a and b (0 <= a,b <= 10^18).
#### Note:
  to store a and b you need more than 32 bits, so watch out! :P

## Output

For each test case print a single integer with the answer.

## Sample input
```text
5
1 1
8 64
4 5
66666666 33333333
576460752303423487 576460752303423487

```
## Sample output

```text
2
2
3
26
118
```
